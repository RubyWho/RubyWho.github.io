### Biography
-----
Welcome! My name is Xinshu and I am a master student major in Cyberspace Security at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/) (NUAA), supervised by Prof. [Zhe Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Em0jNiUAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I received my B.Eng degree from [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nuaa.edu.cn/) in NUAA in 2017.

My research interests lie in the security problems in IoT and blockchain. I've been working on how to apply recent techniques in blockchain to cope with the security problems in IoT. I have also done some works about secure outsourcing scheme and maximizing the lifetime of WSNs.
